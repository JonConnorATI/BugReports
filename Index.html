      <h1 class=>What Makes a Good Bug Report</h1>
      <p class="ost--one">I've been asked this question at every interview, in an interview a few years ago my answer was - that the reproduction steps, the expected vs actual behaviour, evidence and any set up, environment conditions or variables need to be included so that the developer or programmer assigned to fix the defect has all the nescearry information to reproduce the defect and solve the issue.<br><br>
      A couple of days later I got feedback from the company and they said my response on the "Defect Report Criteria" was very weak.<br><br>
      Oh dear I thought, I must have logged thousdands of defects and no one has ever complained about anything like this before.<br><br>
      So I took it on the chin and opened up Jira to write a defect and then it hit me. <em>Ticket ID</em>, never mentioned that, the <em>author</em> never mentioned that, the <em>severity</em> never mentioned that, <em>Open, re opened</em> never mentioned that. So maybe my answer was weak. Don't make the same mistake as me and take the items, that Jira automitically looks after, for granted.<br><br>
      The interviewer never asked me to expand on my answer or say, <q>anything else you can think of?</q> I'd took it as read (Jira was in the job description) that the company was working with Jira, so was assuming they wanted to know what the difference between a good bug report (that gets things fixed) and a bad bug report (wastes time) was. Any way interviews are a different topic altogether, for another day perhaps.<br><br>
      I've never made the same mistake again, I always quote the ISTQB definition of a defect report.</p>
