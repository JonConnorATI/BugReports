      <h1 class=>What Makes a Good Bug Report</h1>
      <p class="ost--one">I have been asked, <q>What makes a good bug report</q> at every interview. It is important because it helps the team fix the bug and provide metrics for the project about defects.<br><br>Opening Jira, the other day to write a ticket it hit me. Jira automatically handles the generation (or prompts for inputs) for many of the items we need to write a good report. For example, <em>ID</em>, <em>Author</em>, <em>Severity</em>, <em>Priority</em>. We shouldn’t take these for granted and understand why they are needed.<br><br>Here is a reminder, if you are preparing for interviews, what actually does make a good bug report from the ISTQB definition of a defect report.</p>
